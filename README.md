# Information-Systems-Databases
## Noah's Pet Clinic Database Project
### Overview
Noah's Pet Clinic Project! This case study focuses on the design and implementation of a database management system to effectively handle pet consultations and appointments. Through this project, I explored various aspects of database management, including entity integrity, functional requirements, and SQL query implementation, all while addressing specific constraints provided in the scenario.

### Learning Outcomes
Describe emerging technologies: The architecture, protocols, and fundamental principles of information systems relevant to the case study was analyzed.
Build foundational knowledge: I applied Various networking technologies to design a distributed system tailored for both wired and virtual environments.
Research and analyze: The capabilities and limitations of database technologies and their applications in a real-world scenario was critically assessed.
Apply transferable skills: I honed skills in systems analysis, database design, and SQL implementation that are directly applicable in industry and research settings.

### Project Structure
### Part I – Systems Analysis & Design
Executive Summary: A concise overview of the project goals and the challenges addressed.
Goals and Requirements: A detailed list of functional and non-functional requirements.
Use Case Diagram: A visual representation of the system's functionalities and user interactions.
Use Case Specifications: In-depth descriptions of specific use cases for clarity and understanding.

### Part II – Database Design & Implementation
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): A top-down ERD outlining the entities and relationships within the system.
Normalization: A thorough normalization process from UNF to 3NF to ensure data integrity.
SQL Implementation: Creation of Oracle tables adhering to entity integrity constraints and the insertion of sample data.
Database Queries: Execution of various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data, demonstrating the system's functionality.

### Part III – Query Implementation
SQL Scripts: Detailed scripts for data retrieval and manipulation, including practical examples and results from the database.
Technologies Used
#### Database Management: Oracle SQL
Data Modeling: Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
#### Normalization Techniques: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF
SQL Queries: SELECT, INSERT, DROP, and CREATE statements
#### Information Security Considerations
In addition to database design, I also considered information security best practices to ensure data protection and integrity within the system. This includes:
Implementing unique constraints (e.g., on doctors' email addresses) to prevent unauthorized access.
Ensuring data validation to maintain the integrity of the information stored in the database.

### Conclusion
This project not only deepened my understanding of information systems and databases but also equipped me with practical skills that I can apply in future endeavors. I look forward to further exploring advancements in database technologies and their applications in enhancing system security.
